#### Saturday
[**Let's Get LA on the map!  The Los Angeles Building Import Case Study**](http://stateofthemap.us/2016/lets-get-la-on-the-map/) [Community]: Video available. Big imports are difficult to coordinate. There's no good standard for cities or communities to use when undertaking projects like this.

[**How can AI help us make maps?**](http://stateofthemap.us/2016/how-can-ai-help-us-make-maps/) [Direction]: Facebook's looking at using machine learning to delineate roads from imagery. It's been somewhat successful. 

[**Beyond Aesthetic Icing: Designing geo tools for humans**](http://stateofthemap.us/2016/beyond-aesthetic-icing/) [Getting Around]: Video available. Focuses on the development of Mapzen's Transitland Playground.

[**OpenStreetMap lights up the world for blind users with sound**](http://stateofthemap.us/2016/osm-lights-up-the-world-for-blind-users-with-sound/) [Getting Around]: Video available. One of my favorite talks of the conference.

#### Sunday
[**Spatial Analysis in the Developing World: Measuring Access with OpenStreetMap & OpenTripPlanner**](http://stateofthemap.us/2016/spatial-analysis-in-the-developing-world/) [Technical]: Video available. Good application of walkshed analysis in Uganda.

[**From an OSM Way to a Highway Shield**](http://stateofthemap.us/2016/from-an-osm-way-to-a-highway-shield/) [Technical]: Video available. Nitty-gritty talk about processing OSM data into a cartographically useful form for Tableau.

[**Befriending a Geocoder**](http://stateofthemap.us/2016/befriending-a-geocoder/) [Technical]: Video available. A history of geocoders and a little bit about making tags useful for geocoders.

[**Validating the Map**](http://stateofthemap.us/2016/validating-the-map/) [Technical]: Video available. Covered the way that Mapbox validates OSM data.

[**Millions that don't care**](http://stateofthemap.us/2016/millions-that-dont-care/) [Tools]: Video available. Maps.me made OSM editing available on their app and ran into some issues. The OSM community doesn't seem fully prepared for an influx of new users. OSM needs better tutorials and ways for people to easily learn how to add data.

[**What if it doesn't belong in OpenStreetMap?**](http://stateofthemap.us/2016/what-if-it-doesnt-belong-in-osm/) [Tools]: Video available. Maphubs appears to be aspiring to be like an ArcGIS online for OSM, where you can add data, style a map, and save it for sharing.

[**OpenStreetView**](http://stateofthemap.us/2016/openstreetview/) [Imagery]: Video available. Telenav is building their own street view product.

* Most of the 5-6 hundred Meetup members you never see.
* Use Meetup to get message to "regular People" rather than just GIS people
* Charging users for Meetup with definitely drive away members
* Meetup Pro allows affiliated Meetups across the country to be messaged at once. But the cost is $15/Meetup instead of 3 for $15.
* Join other Meetups to attract members. Meetups that you think would be interested in OSM.
* Clifford sends a welcome message out to every new mapper in Washington.

Beyond fire hydrant location: what firefighters need to know

* [Youth Mappers](http://www.youthmappers.org/)
  * Teach open source as part of prep for working in the geospatial field.
  * Students often did better in OSM portion of program because they were engaged in helping people
  * US Aid tasks/HOT tasks/Missing Maps tasks
  * Students made official student organization to do humanitarian work on an ongoing basis
    * End up with students teaching students
    * Student started organizations
  * http://teachosm.org/en/
  * http://tasks.teachosm.org/ to keep the HOT tasking manager clear of teaching efforts
  * Consider reaching out to high school students looking for a community service project in order to graduate.
* Ideas for evangelism
  * Get involved in OSM GeoWeek
  * Need to reach out beyond your own community
  * Corporate partnerships not for money but for volunteer time - Missing Maps
    * Do a train the trainer
    * Employees then continue to map on their spare time.
    * Also partner with any kind of established meet-up group
  * Missing Maps: Map Swipe 
    * Even easier than doing a mapathon
  * Mapathon can be your "Gateway drug" to humanitarianism
  * Mapillary & Missing Maps allow you to move people beyond the introduction to OSM and into more advanced tasks.
  * Mapillary publishes stories that get shared as a way to inspire others to do more.
    * Local & National media will pick up these stories sometimes which generates more visibility
  * Target older mappers, give retirees something meaningful  to do.
  * Leverage [Glympse](https://www.glympse.com/) somehow.
* What do you see in the Future
  * We will add 200,000 more people to the map as represented by their buildings.

Faites vos jeux - Here's the New [MapRoulette](http://maproulette.org/)
* [Slides for this presentation](http://Bit.ly/maproulette-workshop)
* After license change had to replace 80-90% of roads in OSM - this gave rise to Map Roulette
* There is an [API](http://maproulette.org:8000/#/Project)
  * Welcome contributions to the documentation
* What makes a great challenge?
  * Tasks are easy to understand
  * Tasks are easy to fix
  * Microtasks - 30 to 120 seconds is ideal
  * Addictive to do
  * Do not require local knowledge
  * Keep the number of tasks for a challenge to be no more than a few thousands.
      * Split by geography to make it smaller
* This is an armchair mapping tool.
* Create data for input
  * 2 entry points
      * Query overpass: A query interface to OSM
      * External data
        * OGR

* Instructions can be formatted with Markdown
* Ideas for map roulette
  * Fixing an import
      * One way streets with random direction
      * Things named Park are not necessarily an recreation amenity
  * Check to see if Parks are already in OSM
  * Add platforms to railway stations
  * Open closed Cliffs
  * Identify Park features 
      * Sub optimal because it's not just one thing.
  * Use municipal sidewalk shape file to code ways as having sidewalks
            
Tagging and mapping for routing and navigation
* What would it take to make OSM navigable?
  * Roads
  * Access Restrictions
  * Turn lanes
  * Speed limits
  * Destination signs
* Cannot rely on imagery. Instead use Mapillary
  * Not just images, but he underlying data.
  * Detects traffic signs
* Mapping Turn lanes in OSM
  * turn:lanes=left
  * turn:lanes=through
* Use JOSM editor
  * Add map paint style for lane and road attributes & traffic signs
    * Tagging presets land attributes
    * Filter out non road features
* Be sure to mark turn lanes all the way through to the intersection. Don't stop it at the crosswalk
* Mark shared parking/driving lanes as lanes and tag them with time based access restrictions
* Don't need to add turn restrictions for one-way streets. That is redundant.
* U-Turn turn lanes
